# 5.3 Creating a pull-request

Once you've discussed a feature, passed your tests and produced a working implementation, it's time to submit a pull-request for code review.

Code review takes place on GitHub in the relevant repository and usually takes a few days based on the importance and/or gravity of the change. It is also here where your code is inspected and discussed further. Maybe there is something not covered in the tests, maybe there is a more performance solution to a particular area or maybe the conventions need work.

The general idea is that once your change passes code review, it's on.
