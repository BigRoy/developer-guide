The current user interface started as a reference implementation with which other user interfaces were to be developed. Since its introduction, the goal of a user interface for publishing has been made more clear and in response a series of improvements and features was added to this implementation.

However, due to this origin, the foundation of the current incarnation is far from strong. Alternatives are most welcome, especially from developers with experience in UI/UX and optionally Qt and Python.
